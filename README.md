https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

You will need to install JavaFx. This will depend on if you run the game on Eclipse or on the Terminal. Follow the instructions below. 


## How to execute the game on Eclipse
* Download all the files from this Github as a Zipped Download. Extract the files and move all files to your desktop for easy access. You may use another folder but you must make sure all the files are in the same folder. Open the Eclipse program and create a new Java Project. Import the files from your desktop to this Java Project. When all files have successfully imported over into the same Project on Eclipse, you are now ready to run the 'Main.java' file to start the game.

## How to execute the game on Terminal
Download all the files from this Github as a Zipped Download. Extract the files and move all files to a folder. Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the files (MyFirstJavaProgram.java). Assume it's C:. Type 'javac FirstFileName.java' for each file name and press enter to compile your code. You will have to compile each file from Github. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption: The path variable is set). Now, type 'java Main' to run the game. You will be able to see the gamespace printed on the window.

# Space Invaders (Graphical User Interface) 

A shooter game in which the player controls a laser ship to remove all aliens from the space. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) has aliens at the top and the ship at the bottom that the user controls at the bottom. The ship can be moved horizontally across the bottom of the screen using the right and left arrow keys while using spacebar to fire bullets at aliens. Each time an alien is hit, the user gains points and the score can be seen on the screen. Each time the user successfully removes all the aliens from the gamespace, the game goes on to another level which is harder. The aliens can also shoot at the ship, which inflicts damage on the user. When three lives are gone or the aliens invade the earth which the ship is protecting, then the user dies (game over). The objective of the game is to kill aliens and get to the highest level and highest score as possible.

## Prerequisites
You will need to install JDK(Java Development Kit) and an IDE, for example Eclipse.

To set up a Java Development Environment, follow the download links:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/archive-139210.html
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klob1me6O6Q

You will need to install JavaFx. Follow the instructions below.

## How to execute the game on Eclipse
â€¢ Download all the files from the master branch as a Zipped Download. Extract the src folder from the SpaceInvaders folder. Open the Eclipse program. Install JavaFX following the instructions on this link: 

https://bittlife.com/install-javafx-eclipse/

Create a new Java FX Project and import the GitHub project into Eclipse following the instructions on this link: 

https://github.com/collab-uniba/socialcde4eclipse/wiki/How-to-import-a-GitHub-project-into-Eclipse

Import the files from the src to this Java Project. You will run the Menu.java from the GUI to start the game. A popup window will appear and the user can start playing the game. You may use another folder but you must make sure all the files are in the same folder. 

## How to execute the game on Terminal
Download all the files from this Github as a Zipped Download. Extract the src folder from SpaceInvaders. Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the file. Ensure all the files are in the same directory. Assume it's C:. Type 'javac Menu.java' to compile your code. You will have to compile each file from the SpaceInvaders folder from Github. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption: The path variable is set). Now, type 'java Menu' to run the game. You will be able to see the gamespace printed on the window.
